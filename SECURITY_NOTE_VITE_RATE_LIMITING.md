# Security Note: Vite Development Server Rate Limiting

## Vulnerability Identified
CodeQL has identified a missing rate limiting vulnerability in `server/vite.ts`:
- The catch-all route handler (`app.use("*")`) performs file system operations without rate limiting
- This could potentially be exploited for denial-of-service attacks in development

## Context
- **Severity**: Low (Development Only)
- **File**: `server/vite.ts` (protected configuration file)
- **Impact**: Only affects development server, not production

## Current Status
This vulnerability exists only in the development environment where:
1. The Vite middleware serves files dynamically for hot module replacement
2. File system access is required for development features
3. The server is typically only accessible locally

## Production Security
The production build is NOT affected because:
1. Static files are served through `express.static()` in production
2. All production routes have proper rate limiting applied via security middleware
3. The Vite development server is not used in production

## Mitigation
While we cannot modify the protected Vite configuration file, the following mitigations are in place:
1. Development server is only accessible locally by default
2. Production deployments use pre-built static files with proper rate limiting
3. General API rate limiting (500 requests/15 minutes) applies to other routes

## Recommendation
For enhanced security in development environments:
1. Ensure development server is not exposed to public networks
2. Use environment-specific firewall rules
3. Monitor for unusual file access patterns

## Note
This is a known limitation of the development tooling and does not affect the security of deployed applications.
