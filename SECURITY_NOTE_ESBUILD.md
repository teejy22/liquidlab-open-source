# Security Note: esbuild CORS Vulnerability

## Issue
The security vulnerability you've shared affects esbuild's development server, which allows any website to fetch resources due to `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` header being set on all responses.

## Our Setup
- We use **Vite** for development, not esbuild directly
- Vite uses esbuild internally for transformations but has its own dev server
- Our Express server handles CORS through our custom middleware

## Current Protection
1. **Production**: Our CORS configuration in `server/security/cors.ts` restricts origins properly
2. **Development**: Vite dev server is only accessible locally (localhost)
3. **API Protection**: All API endpoints go through Express with proper CORS validation

## Recommendations
1. Always use production builds for deployment
2. Never expose development servers to the internet
3. Keep Vite and dependencies updated for security patches

## No Action Required
Our current setup is not vulnerable to this specific issue because:
- We don't use esbuild's serve feature directly
- Our API endpoints have proper CORS protection
- Development servers should never be exposed publicly
