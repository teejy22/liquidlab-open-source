# PWA Security Vulnerabilities Analysis

## Critical Security Issues Found

### 1. **Sensitive Data Caching** 游댮 HIGH RISK
**Issue**: Service worker caches ALL API responses without filtering
- User positions, balances, and trading history cached in browser
- Cached data persists even after logout
- No encryption on cached sensitive data

**Impact**: 
- Shared devices could expose user trading data
- Browser dev tools can access cached financial information
- Malicious browser extensions could read cache

### 2. **Missing Authentication Checks** 游댮 HIGH RISK
**Issue**: Service worker doesn't verify user authentication before serving cached data
- Cached API responses served to any user
- No session validation in service worker
- Logout doesn't clear sensitive cache

**Impact**:
- Previous user's data could be served to next user
- Session hijacking through cache exploitation

### 3. **Unrestricted API Caching** 游리 MEDIUM RISK
**Issue**: All API endpoints cached including sensitive ones
- `/api/auth/user` - User profile and wallet info
- `/api/hyperliquid/balances` - Account balances
- `/api/trades/*` - Trading history
- `/api/platforms/*` - Platform configurations

### 4. **Background Sync Vulnerability** 游리 MEDIUM RISK
**Issue**: Mentioned "offline trade submission" but not implemented
- If implemented without proper security, could allow replay attacks
- Trades could be modified while offline
- No integrity checks mentioned

### 5. **Push Notification Security** 游리 MEDIUM RISK
**Issue**: Push notifications mentioned for "price alerts"
- Could leak trading positions if not properly secured
- No mention of encryption for push payloads
- Subscription endpoints not protected

### 6. **Cross-Origin Cache Poisoning** 游리 MEDIUM RISK
**Issue**: Service worker doesn't validate response origins properly
- Could cache malicious responses from compromised CDNs
- No integrity checks on cached resources

### 7. **No Cache Expiration for Sensitive Data** 游리 MEDIUM RISK
**Issue**: Sensitive data cached indefinitely
- User sessions cached without expiration
- No automatic purge of old sensitive data

## Recommended Fixes

1. **Implement Selective Caching**
   - Only cache public assets and non-sensitive data
   - Exclude all /api/auth/*, /api/trades/*, /api/hyperliquid/* endpoints

2. **Add Authentication Layer**
   - Check session validity before serving cached responses
   - Clear cache on logout

3. **Encrypt Sensitive Cache**
   - Use CryptoJS or Web Crypto API for cache encryption
   - Store encryption keys in sessionStorage (cleared on close)

4. **Implement Cache Policies**
   - Set short TTL for any API responses (5 minutes max)
   - Clear sensitive cache every 30 minutes

5. **Secure Background Sync**
   - If implementing offline trades, use signed requests
   - Validate trade integrity on sync

6. **Remove/Secure Push Notifications**
   - Either remove push notification support
   - Or implement end-to-end encryption for notifications
