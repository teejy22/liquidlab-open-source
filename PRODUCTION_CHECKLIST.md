### 9. Performance Optimization
- [ ] Enable CDN for static assets
- [ ] Implement caching strategy
- [ ] Optimize database queries
- [ ] Add request/response compression
- [ ] Configure proper rate limits

### 10. Legal & Compliance
- [ ] Terms of Service
- [ ] Privacy Policy
- [ ] Cookie Policy
- [ ] GDPR compliance

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

1. **Set up production environment**
   ```bash
   # Set all required environment variables
   # Run database migrations
   npm run db:push
   ```

2. **Configure Batch Processing**
   - The system now uses batch processing instead of webhooks
   - Trades are checked every 10 minutes automatically
   - No Hyperliquid registration required
   - Manual processing available at `/api/trades/process-batch`

3. **Configure Privy for production**
   - Create production Privy app
   - Configure allowed domains
   - Set up social login providers

4. **Deploy application**
   - Build production bundle
   - Deploy to Replit or preferred hosting
   - Configure environment variables
   - Test all critical paths

5. **Post-deployment verification**
   - Test wallet connection
   - Verify trading functionality
   - Confirm webhook receives events
   - Check revenue tracking
   - Validate admin dashboard

## üìä Monitoring Checklist

- [ ] Platform creation rate
- [ ] Trade volume per platform
- [ ] Revenue generation
- [ ] API response times
- [ ] Error rates
- [ ] User authentication success rate
- [ ] Webhook processing success

## üîê Security Checklist

- [ ] All secrets in environment variables
- [ ] No hardcoded credentials
- [ ] API keys properly hashed
- [ ] Sessions configured securely
- [ ] CORS properly restricted
- [ ] Rate limiting active
- [ ] Audit logs capturing all actions

## üìù Documentation Needed

- [ ] API documentation for platform owners
- [ ] Webhook integration guide
- [ ] Platform setup tutorial
- [ ] Revenue tracking explanation
- [ ] Security best practices
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide

## Next Immediate Steps

1. **Contact Hyperliquid** to register your webhook endpoint
2. **Set up production Privy app** with proper configuration
3. **Configure production environment variables**
4. **Test the complete flow** from platform creation to revenue tracking
5. **Set up monitoring** to ensure system health

## Domain Configuration Notes

The application is configured for **liquidlab.trade** domain:
- Main site: `https://liquidlab.trade`
- App subdomain: `https://app.liquidlab.trade`
- Webhook URLs use: `https://api.liquidlab.trade/`
- Platform subdomains: `https://[platform-name].liquidlab.trade`

Make sure to update DNS records and SSL certificates for the `.trade` domain.

The infrastructure is well-architected and ready for production deployment. The batch processing system is implemented and will automatically track trades every 10 minutes, providing a cost-effective alternative to maintaining expensive 24/7 WebSocket connections.

**Important Note**: Hyperliquid currently only offers WebSocket streaming (not traditional webhooks). Our batch processing approach checks for new trades periodically, which is much more cost-effective than maintaining a persistent WebSocket connection that would receive all Hyperliquid trades globally.
