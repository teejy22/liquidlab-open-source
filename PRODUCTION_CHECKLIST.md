DATABASE_URL=your_production_database_url
SESSION_SECRET=your_secure_session_secret
ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH=your_bcrypt_admin_password_hash
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_sendgrid_key (for email notifications)
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_key (for payment processing)
```

### 3. Custom Domain Support
- [ ] Update `platformCors` middleware to check `platformDomains` table
- [ ] Implement domain verification process
- [ ] Set up wildcard SSL certificate for *.liquidlab.com

- [ ] Add payout tracking and reporting
- [ ] Handle failed payouts and retries

### 5. Monitoring & Observability
- [ ] Set up error tracking (Sentry or similar)
- [ ] Implement application performance monitoring
- [ ] Configure uptime monitoring
- [ ] Set up alerts for critical errors
- [ ] Create health check endpoints

### 6. Backup & Recovery
- [ ] Set up automated database backups
- [ ] Test backup restoration process
- [ ] Document recovery procedures
- [ ] Implement data retention policies

### 7. Production Database
- [ ] Run database migrations
- [ ] Create indexes for frequently queried fields
- [ ] Set up connection pooling
- [ ] Configure read replicas for scaling

### 8. Security Hardening
- [ ] Enable HTTPS everywhere
- [ ] Implement request signing for sensitive endpoints
- [ ] Add DDoS protection (Cloudflare or similar)
- [ ] Regular security audits
- [ ] Implement IP allowlisting for admin routes

### 9. Performance Optimization
- [ ] Enable CDN for static assets
- [ ] Implement caching strategy
- [ ] Optimize database queries
- [ ] Add request/response compression
- [ ] Configure proper rate limits

### 10. Legal & Compliance
- [ ] Terms of Service
- [ ] Privacy Policy
- [ ] Cookie Policy
- [ ] GDPR compliance
- [ ] Financial regulations compliance

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

1. **Set up production environment**
   ```bash
   # Set all required environment variables
   # Run database migrations
   npm run db:push
   ```

2. **Register Hyperliquid webhook**
   - Contact Hyperliquid to register webhook URL: `https://api.liquidlab.com/api/webhooks/hyperliquid`
   - Provide verification endpoint: `https://api.liquidlab.com/api/webhooks/hyperliquid/verify`
   - Store provided webhook secret

3. **Configure Privy for production**
   - Create production Privy app
   - Configure allowed domains
   - Set up social login providers

4. **Deploy application**
   - Build production bundle
   - Deploy to Replit or preferred hosting
   - Configure environment variables
   - Test all critical paths

5. **Post-deployment verification**
   - Test wallet connection
   - Verify trading functionality
   - Confirm webhook receives events
   - Check revenue tracking
   - Validate admin dashboard

## üìä Monitoring Checklist

- [ ] Platform creation rate
- [ ] Trade volume per platform
- [ ] Revenue generation
- [ ] API response times
- [ ] Error rates
- [ ] User authentication success rate
- [ ] Webhook processing success

## üîê Security Checklist

- [ ] All secrets in environment variables
- [ ] No hardcoded credentials
- [ ] API keys properly hashed
- [ ] Sessions configured securely
- [ ] CORS properly restricted
- [ ] Rate limiting active
- [ ] Audit logs capturing all actions

## üìù Documentation Needed

- [ ] API documentation for platform owners
- [ ] Webhook integration guide
- [ ] Platform setup tutorial
- [ ] Revenue tracking explanation
- [ ] Security best practices
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide

## Next Immediate Steps

1. **Contact Hyperliquid** to register your webhook endpoint
2. **Set up production Privy app** with proper configuration
3. **Configure production environment variables**
4. **Test the complete flow** from platform creation to revenue tracking
5. **Set up monitoring** to ensure system health

The infrastructure is well-architected and ready for production deployment. The main missing piece is the Hyperliquid webhook registration, which will enable automatic fee tracking when trades occur on the platforms.
